## Project
- Angular 21 with standalone components
- State management: NgRx Signal Store  
- UI: Angular Material with custom theme
- API: REST with HttpClient + httpResource()
- Testing: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)

## Conventions
- Feature-based folder structure: feature-name/{components,services,store,models,routes}
- All components use OnPush change detection
- API calls through services, never directly in components
- Barrel exports (index.ts) for every feature folder

## Commands
- `npm run test` – Run Vitest
- `npm run e2e` – Run Playwright  
- `npm run lint` – ESLint check
- `npm run build` – Production build

## What to Avoid
- No NgModules, no CommonModule imports
- No constructor injection
- No *ngIf/*ngFor (use @if/@for)
- No subscribe() in components
